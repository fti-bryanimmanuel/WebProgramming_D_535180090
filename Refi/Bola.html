                <p>Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland are among the names on the final shortlist for the 2020 European Golden Boy award.
                    The final 20 nominations for the annual prize distributed by Italian newspaper Tuttosport have been confirmed, with the continent's best player under the age of 21 set to be revealed on December 14.
                </p>
                <p>Lionel Messi, Paul Pogba, Kylian Mbappe and Matthijs de Ligt have all won the award in the past, while last year's prize was given to Atletico Madrid's Joao Felix following his breakthrough season at Benfica.
                    Sancho finished second in the 2019 voting while his Borussia Dortmund team-mate Haaland came in fourth after a prolific start to the 2019-20 campaign at Red Bull Salzburg, which ultimately earned him a move to Westfalenstadion in January.
                </p>
            </div>
                <p>Both men are in contention to win the prize again this time around, with Sancho now reportedly valued at around €120 million (£108m/$140m) after another outstanding year in Germany while Haaland is attracting attention from Real Madrid after scoring 21 goals in his first 23 outings for BVB.
                    Elsewhere, Barcelona teenager Ansu Fati and Bayern Munich full-back Alphonso Davies have both been nominated for the second time, while Rennes midfielder Eduardo Camavinga has also been included.
                    Six players have been nominated from the Premier League in total, with Manchester City pair Phil Foden and Ferran Torres making the final cut along with Manchester United's Mason Greenwood, Wolves striker Fabio Silva, Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi and Arsenal starlet Bukayo Saka.
                    Barcelona's new signing Sergino Dest has also been named in the final 20, having been rewarded for a bright start to his career at Ajax with a €21 million (£19m/$20m) move to Camp Nou.
                    Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo are representing Real Madrid in the shortlist, while Juventus midfielder Dejan Kulusevski, Paris Saint-Germain defender Mitchel Bakker, Lille forward Jonathan David, Ajax prospect Ryan Gravenberch, Salzburg's Dominik Szoboszlai, and Milan playmaker Sandro Tonali complete the nominees.
                    The final winner will be decided by a panel of 40 journalists from across Europe, with a new name set to be carved on the trophy as the next generation of talent continues to emerge.

            <h3 id="ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo Tests Positive for COVID-19, Will Self-Isolate</h3>
            <p>Portugal announced Tuesday that Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo has tested positive for COVID-19.
                On Oct. 3, Juventus announced two of its staff members had also tested positive. As a result, all those involved with the club had gone into self-isolation.
            </p>
            <p>Portugal had a pair of matches last week, drawing 0-0 with Spain in a friendly and earning the same score in Sunday's UEFA Nations League fixture with France. Ronaldo's positive test will rule him out of Wednesday's Nations League clash with Sweden.
                Portugal said in Tuesday's statement (h/t ESPN) that no other players had a positive test. Upon the conclusion of the Sweden fixture, Portugal won't be in action again until Nov. 11.
            </p>
            </div>
            <p>Under Italy's COVID-19 protocols, Ronaldo will have to isolate for 10 days. That will rule him out for Saturday's Serie A clash with Crotone and Juve's Champions League opener with Dynamo Kiev on Oct. 20.
                He could be cleared to return Oct. 25 against Hellas Verona. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner might also be available when Juventus play Lionel Messi and Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League.
            </p>
            <p>Juventus have one win and one draw through their first two Serie A matches as they look to claim a 10th straight league title.
                Juventus were scheduled to play Napoli on Oct. 4, but the latter cited local health recommendations and declined to make the trip to Allianz Stadium. Under league rules, Juve should be awarded a 3-0 victory, a result that isn't yet reflected in the Serie A table.

                <h3>Barcelona expect Lionel Messi to complete Man City transfer next summer</h3>
                <p>The Argentine came close to leaving Camp Nou this summer only to make a U-turn on his decision - but the Catalan giants are resigned to losing him to City at the end of this season
                    Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman is resigned to losing Lionel Messi to Manchester City next year.
                    Koeman has revealed how a heart-to-heart talk with the Argentine convinced him to focus himself on the Barca cause for one last season after Messi had made it clear he wanted to quit the Nou Camp to join Pep Guardiola at the Etihad.
                </p>
                <p>Barcelona's beleaguered president Josep Maria Bartomeu refused to accept the 33-year-old's claim that he could quit the club for free - and insisted that the £630million buy-out clause in his contract would have to be met in full for him to leave.
                    But while Koeman has been delighted with Messi's response, he has already accepted that he will not get to work with the six-time Ballon d'Or winner beyond the current season.
                </p>
            </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 text-center">
                    <figure class="figure"></figure>
                    <img src="img/messi.jpg" class="img-thumbnail float-left">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Lionel Messi celebrating after scoring a goal against Celta Vigo</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Koeman said: “I was always hoping Messi would stay for this season. If he had left in the summer, I would have had a very different situation at Barca.
                    “He wanted to leave but the club was very clear to him. The buy out clause was so high, that not a single club in the world was going to pay that in these times.
                </p>
                <p>“I went to his house and took time to listen to all the things he said. But I also explained to him that I had not been a part of the problems he had with the club and told him how I was going to work to change things.
                    “We ended up talking football tactics. It ended as a proper football chat and that convinced me he is a real lover of the game and he still wanted to put everything he has into Barcelona.”
                </p>
                <p>Koeman's confession that he is not counting on Messi beyond the current season is huge news for City as they look to secure Guardiola's future.
                    The Catalan has been a close friend of the Dutchman since they were team-mates in the Barcelona team that lifted the club's first European Cup in 1992.
                    Guardiola's contract expires at the end of the season after five years in Manchester.
                    And it's unthinkable that Messi would agree to sign for the Blues without Guardiola signing a new deal.
                    Koeman has been hugely impressed with the Argentine's attitude and form.
                </p>
                <p>He added: “It was more a question of how I was going to get Leo's mind in the right frame on and off the pitch.
                    “I had to get him right as a person and as a player. When he came back in for training I could only see good signs. His attitude, his spirit - there was not a thing I could criticise him for.
                </p>
                <p>“He is still superb. The great thing with Messi is that when he sees a ball, he has fun. The way he sees things in a game is absolutely fantastic.
                    "He is not only smart as a player, he also still executes every action with the ball with the highest perfection.”
